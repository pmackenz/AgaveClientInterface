Agave to QT Client Interface

This library is intended to be included in QT projects which seek to communicate with an Agave server.

The AgaveClientInterface.pri file can be imported by a project which uses this repo.

An (as-yet-incomplete) documentation of the code can be found at: https://nheri-simcenter.github.io/AgaveClientInterface/
